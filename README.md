## 🧠 AI Implementation Details

### Minimax Algorithm (Expert Level)
```python
def minimax(depth, is_maximizing, alpha=-∞, beta=∞):
    if terminal_state:
        return evaluate_position()
    
    if is_maximizing:
        max_eval = -∞
        for move in available_moves:
            eval = minimax(depth+1, False, alpha, beta)
            max_eval = max(max_eval, eval)
            alpha = max(alpha, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break  # Alpha-beta pruning
        return max_eval
```

### Strategic Heuristics (Medium/Hard)
- **Winning move detection**: Immediate win opportunities
- **Blocking moves**: Prevent opponent wins
- **Center control**: Prioritize center position (4)
- **Corner preference**: Strategic corner positioning
- **Edge avoidance**: Minimize edge play when possible

### Q-Learning Implementation
- **State representation**: 9-position board encoding
- **Action space**: Valid moves (0-8)
- **Reward system**: +1 win, -1 loss, 0 tie
